TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

1. I was a bit busy with my works, so i only got about 1 hour to complete it.
2. If i had more time i would have created a fully functional front end, and spend a little more time designing the db.
3. Most of the usefull features were already there in javascript when i started. The most useful features i find in javascript compared to other languages    are(c,c++,java) object/array destructuring, async programming, spread operator, JSON, event driven programming, Nullish coalescing operator (??), Object    Shorthand, Optional chaining (?.)
4. Performance is optimised by use of memoization in react, next cursor(only fetches a limited data from db and stores the id of last data to fetch next      set of data), store data fetched from db into state management to avoid refetching.
